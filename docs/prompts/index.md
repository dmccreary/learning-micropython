# Using Generative AI Prompts to Generate MicroPython Code

This book includes a collection of sample prompts that
can be used to have generative AI tools generate debug and create
working MicroPython code for your project.  We think
that this is a great way to learn MicroPython and we highly
encourage you to use these tools.

Central to getting good working code is "grounding" your generative AI model in the concepts used in this course.  Our goal is to teach computational thinking to students in a fun low-cost way.  Loading our [Learning Graph](../sims/learning-graph/index.md) into your generative AI project is a great way to anchor your responses and avoid hallucinations.  As of this writing (February 2025), both Anthropic Clause and OpenAI ChatGPT support projects.
