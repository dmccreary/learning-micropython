# Acknowledgements

I wish to thank many people that have given me detailed feedback on the Learning MicroPython project.

Specifically I wish to thank [Jim Tannenbaum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jetannenbaum/) who has not only given me excellent feedback but has also gone on to implement many [BIPES](https://bipes.net.br/wp/) block programming extensions to allow student to learn MicroPython with block programming.

I also wish to thank [Valerie Lockhart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valockhart/) for her continued support and the inspiration for adding the [MicroSims](../sims/index.md) section to the
website.

Teaching students in rural areas that don't have access to high-tech curriculum has also
been a goal of ours.  I wish to thank [Carl Boudreau](https://www.linkedin.com/in/graphy-giraffe/)
for his excellent work brining MicroPython to these areas and his allowing us to add his [Barnyard RIFD Project](../kits/rfid-rc522/index.md) to this course.

Integrating [generative AI](../prompts/index.md) into this curriculum as our [related projects] was encouraged by my lifelong friend and mentor, [Arun Batchu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunbatchu/).  I will be forever in your debt for your continued support.

Lastly, I wish to thank my wife, Ann Kelly and my daughters, Alona and Mary, and the reset of my family for they continued encouragement in helping students from around the world learn computational thinking.
