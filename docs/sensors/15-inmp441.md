# INMP441 Microphone

The INMP441 is a high-performance, low power, digital-output,
omnidirectional MEMS microphone with a bottom port. The
complete INMP441 solution consists of a MEMS sensor, signal
conditioning, an analog-to-digital converter, anti-aliasing filters,
power management, and an industry-standard 24-bit I²S interface.
The I²S interface allows the INMP441 to connect directly to digital
processors, such as DSPs and microcontrollers, without the need
for an audio codec in the system.
